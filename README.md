- 👋 Hi, I’m Amar Maharjan (@amarmhrjn).
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Registration, Research etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep learning approaches (and their flaws!).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reseach in computer vision topics such as non-rigid point set registration.
- Besides these, I am also interested in programming languages and compiler technologies.
